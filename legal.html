                We are Inplace. Our full company name is Inplace Ltd, our registered office is at King George V Lodge,
				King George V Road, Amersham, England HP6 5FB and our company number is 11793638.<br>
                We are registered with the Information Commssioner’s Office with number [ ].<br>
				If you would like to contact us with a question about how we use your data, the quickest way to do that
				is to contact us by email at [ ].
            </p> <br>

            <p class="text">
				<h2 class="header">WHAT DATA DO WE COLLECT?</h2>

			    When you use one of our games, you will be asked to consent to use of your data as set out in this
				policy. If you provide your consent, we collect the following information:
				The model and manufacturer of the device you are using.
				Your Device ID (this is a unique number that identifies your specific device).
				Your Advertising ID (this is a unique number that is used to understand your advertising preferences.
				You can reset this in your device’s menu). <br>
				A list of the applications installed on the device you are using. But if this reveals sensitive data
				about you (such as your health) then we delete this data quickly.<br>
				Whether you are connected over WiFi, a mobile connection, or neither.<br>
				Taps, interactions and screenshots of the game you are playing.<br>
				Information passed to us by the brands whose skins you have applied.<br>
				Information passed to us by Facebook and other social media platforms, such as your interests, age and
				employment. <br>
				Browser tracking data that can be linked to your device or advertising ID.
				Our lawful basis to do this under data protection law is consent. You do not have to provide your
				consent, and you can withdraw your consent at any time by clicking here or following the instructions
				provided in all of our apps.<br>
				If you do not consent, we collect [ ] to detect and prevent fraudulent use of our platform, and for
				error reporting. The lawful basis we rely on under data protection legislation to do this is our
				legitimate interest to prevent fraud and ensure our platform is working correctly.
			</p> <br>

            <p class="text">
               <h2 class="header">WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR DATA WITH?</h2>
			    The brands whose skins your apply
				When you apply a skin in our games, we will share the data listed above with the brand whose skin you
				have chosen to apply. <br>
				We do this so the brand can understand who is showing an interest in them, and so they can track the
				success of their advertising campaign with us. For example, sharing this data with the brand enables
				them to see that applying an in-game skin led to the same person downloading that brand’s mobile
				application a few days later.<br>
				The identity of the brand will always be communicated to you before you decide to apply the skin.
				Other companies who help us run our business.<br>
				We use other companies to help us with data storage, customer service, payment processing, website
				hosting and development, and security. Each of our subcontractors has signed up to data protection
				contracts with us, where they can only use the data they have access to in line with our instructions.<br>
				To keep this notice as short as possible, we haven’t listed all of these companies here. But if you
				would like more detail, please contact us at [ ].

            <p class="text">
            <h2 class="header">WHERE IS MY DATA STORED?</h2>
			
            	We store your data in the EU.<br>
            	
				Whenever we transfer your personal information outside of the UK and the EU, we ensure it receives
				additional protection as required by law. To keep this privacy policy as short and easy to understand as
				possible, we haven’t set out the specific circumstances when each of these protection measures are used.<br>
				You can contact us at [ ] for more detail on this. 
            </p><br>
            <p class="text">	
				<h2 class="header">HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA FOR?</h2> <br>
			    We will only retain your personal data for 60 days after you provided your consent, unless we are
				required to keep it for longer to comply with our legal, accounting or regulatory requirements.<br>

				We also carefully anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you, and
				because this information is anonymised, we can use it indefinitely without notifying you.
            </p><br>

            <p class="text">
			<h2 class="header">WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS UNDER DATA PROTECTION LAWS?</h2>
           
				You have various other rights under applicable data protection laws, including the right to:
				<ul>
                <li class="text">access your personal data (also known as a “subject access request”);</li>
				<li class="text">correct incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you;</li>
				<li class="text">ask us to erase the personal data we hold about you;</li>
				<li class="text">ask us to restrict our handling of your personal data;</li>
				<li class="text">ask us to transfer your personal data to a third party;</li>
				<li class="text">object to how we are using your personal data; and</li>
				<li class="text">withdraw your consent to us handling your personal data.</li>

				you all of the time.

            <p class="text">
				<h2 class="header">QUESTIONS, COMMENTS AND MORE DETAIL</h2>
            
				We’ve worked hard to create a notice that’s easy to read and clear. But if you feel that we have
				overlooked an important perspective or used language which you think we could improve, please let us
		    	know by email at [ ]. Your feedback and suggestions on this notice are welcome.
